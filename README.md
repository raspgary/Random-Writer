• Utilized Python to develop a program that builds a statistical model of information linked to a given URL
and output to a file or pickle a stream of data similar to the original but randomly generated
• Programmed a Markov Chain with a graph containing nodes as states, edges as tokens, and scratches for each
edge based on frequency in the given data
• Implemented different sophistication levels of output by windowing the data by different sizes
